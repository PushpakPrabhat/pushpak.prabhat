      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever Googled yourself, half-curious, half-dreading what you might find? It’s a modern ritual of self-discovery. But it led me to a different question: What if you could design your own search result? What if your life &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; the search result, with all its complexities, side projects, and &amp;ldquo;People also ask&amp;rdquo; quirks?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the answer. This portfolio, wrapped in the familiar comfort of the world’s biggest search engine. We turn to Google for answers, for clarity in a sea of information. This website is my attempt to provide a little clarity on the curated chaos of my own life, both for you and for myself. It’s a playful nod to the idea that we are all, in essence, searching for something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
